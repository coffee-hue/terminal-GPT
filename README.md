# terminal-GPT
Use of the chatgpt api to create a terminal chat-gpt client, I have stopped working on this project as I dont believe it would have reworld use and seeming to pay for openai API keys I would have like to seen what I could have created with the click library 

### use
Installtion

```pip3 install poetry```
installing dependacies
```python3 -m poetry install```

run
```python -m src.cli --help```


Dont forget in the config.ini to add you api key
